# exa_toolkit
Scripts to navigate transcriptomics. I started writing bash scripts for tasks with multiple trivial steps, that are annoying and unsafe to do manually. 
I summarize those scripts in the exa toolkit, named after the first bash script I ever wrote (exa.sh; extract transcript annotations).
